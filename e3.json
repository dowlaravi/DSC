    "Question": "Identify the type of sentence: 'To err is human, to forgive, divine.'",
    "A": "Simple Sentence",
    "B": "Complex Sentence",
    "C": "Compound Sentence",
    "D": "Compound-Complex Sentence",
    "Answer": "Simple Sentence",
    "Explanation": "This sentence contains two principal clauses ('To err is human,' and 'to forgive, divine'), but they are often treated as a single compound idea or an instance of elliptical structure in this form, containing one main thought. However, the most accurate structural classification is that of two coordinate clauses, hence **Compound Sentence** if interpreted strictly with an implied 'it is'. Since 'to err' and 'to forgive' are non-finite verbs (infinitives), they don't form finite clauses. The sentence is actually a single simple sentence with two infinitival phrases acting as subjects, making **Simple Sentence** the acceptable answer in this context."
